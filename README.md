The main file required to run simulation is var_param_sim.py.

Please note that in order to run the simulation GPOPS-II licence and SUMO installations are required.

More details regarding installating coming soon.

The GPR models that were obtained as a result of running the simulation are not included here due to their size but are available on request.
