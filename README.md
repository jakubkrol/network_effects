The main file required to run simulation is var_param_sim.py.

Please note that in order to run the simulation GPOPS-II licence and SUMO installations are required.

More details regarding installation is coming soon...

The GPR models that were obtained as a result of running the simulation are not included here due to their size but are available on request. 

** SUMO Installation **

Below is the link to the SUMO installation guide

https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/index.html

We have included a sumo standalone folder which allows to run the simulation in the Selly Oak area of Birmingham without inclusion of eco-vehicles. In order to run the simulation please run simpleTest.py file in the 4_simulation folder. It is possible that some paths will have to be added so that the file is able to find the sellyOak model files that are located in 2_models/sellyOak folder.
